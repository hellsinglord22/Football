## How to use the mocking server ?
1. Download [Node.js](www.nodejs.org)
2. clone the repo using this command `git clone https://github.com/hellsinglord22/Football`
3. `cd Football`
4. install the node dependencies and start the server . `npm install && npm start`.

### **notes**: 
- If you want to make sure than node.js is installed run `npm --version`. 
- you need to run the command at step 4 within the project directory.
- The server will be working on `localhost:3000`
